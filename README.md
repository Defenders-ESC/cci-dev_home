# Homepage for [](https://cci-dev.org)

Everything needed to make the CCI-dev homepage work.

## Instructions

If you add or remove an app/analysis/etc. from the CCI-dev server, then update
the homepage. Fork this repo and edit `index.html`. If adding a new element,
find the HTML chunk for an existing element, copy-and-paste, and edit. Be sure
to add a new bootstrap `class="row"` if the final row already has three columns.
Once you have tested the edits (in desktop, half-page, and mobile device modes),
submit a pull request.
